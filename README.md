# machine_learning_for_linguistics
This repository contains tutorials for some statistical and machine learning techniques in Python, with applications in linguistic research. Specifically, the Jupyter notebook "k_means_and_efa.ipynb" will provide a tutorial of k-means clustering and exploratory factor analysis (EFA).

If you do not already have a way to access JupyterLab on your computer, you can visit <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual> to download Anaconda Navigator, which will give you access to JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook.
